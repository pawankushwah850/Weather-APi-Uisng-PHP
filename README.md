# Weather-APi-Uisng-PHP
Hi there, i am using Api to get the weather info. in our website, Now here is simple tutorial , to learning .  inside the code i using PHP, Bootstrap, html, css..  required -> basic Knowledge of PHP, and cURL lib in php.


https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php this link to read more berif using Curl lib of php.

curl -> Client url library.

Defination : cURL is a library that lets you make HTTP requests in PHP. Everything you need to know about it (and most other extensions) can be found in the PHP manual. In order to use PHP's cURL functions you need to install the Â» libcurl package. PHP requires that you use libcurl 7.0.


/*   basic info about this */

I needed to use cURL in a php script to download data using not only SSL for the server authentication but also for client authentication. 

CURL failed with PHP5.3 and Apache2.2.X on my Windows 7 machine.

It turns out that it's not enough to copy the two dll's mentioned (libeay32 and sslea32) from the php folder into your system32 folder. You HAVE TO UNBLOCK THESE TWO FILES.

Right click the file, select unblock, for each one. Then restart Apache.

Another very handy security feature added into Windows.
